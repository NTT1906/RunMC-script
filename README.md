# RunMC-script
A script to start Minecraft with quick loading screen

There are 5 files in this repository, 3 of which are identical scripts in various script languages. Regedit script for temp-bypass demo :c

I assumed you could execute this script anywhere to launch Minecraft immediately when working on your server, I guessed?

You could do something like this
```shell
call run_mc\start_mc.cmd
or
start cmd /c run_mc\start_mc.cmd
```
where the first command help you run the script inside the terminal where you started the script
or the following for creating new terminal
